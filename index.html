            <h1> Dynamics of Football Passes</h1>
            <p> <br> <br>
                Have you ever wondered the extent to which passing impacts the outcome of football? To study this, we
                have built a dashboard with the primary goal of answering the following research
                questions:
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="tab"></span>1. How does passing behavior influence the outcome of a game?
                <br> <br> <span class="tab"></span>2. What is the impact of different players in the overall performance
                of
                the game?
                <br> <br> <span class="tab"></span>3. What are the passing styles and patterns of a particular team?

                <strong>Publication:</strong>
                <br>We were inspired by the publication “PassVizor: Toward Better Understanding of the Dynamics of
                Soccer Passes”, published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030359">IEEE Transactions on
                    Visualization and Computer Graphics</a>. The idea behind the paper is to derive underlying patterns
                in football passes to try to better understand the attacking styles. This helps in analyzing how players
                build an attack using different passing tactics.
            </p>

                <strong>Motivation:</strong>
                <br> Football is a passing game. Although the outcome of a game is determined by the number of goals
                scored, it wouldn’t be possible to score goals without passing the ball. It is also important to
                acknowledge the fact that goal scoring is a team effort. The contributions of players in different
                positions must be accounted for to develop a proper understanding of the impact of players in a
                particular game.
                <br> Moreover, there is a misconception that goal scorers are the most important players in a team. From
                an informed standpoint, this is not true in most cases and there are several players contributing to the
                success of a team. This dashboard will clear this misconception and enable the viewer to have a better
                understanding of the game and players’ importance represented through
                passing dynamics.

                The subset of data selected is from a match between Real Madrid and Liverpool with a goal outcome of 3-1. 

                <br> <br> Here, we have filtered all the
                passes involving players of Real Madrid.
                
                <br> <br> Real Madrid scored the goals at 50th, 63rd, and 82nd minutes. 
                
                <br><br> There were also shots attempted at minutes 10, 14, 31, 32, 42, 44, 47, 50, 59, 63, 73, 81, and 82.
