    We are attempting to replicate parts of the above article's Figure 4, image of the original Figure is <a href="https://github.com/bashirhamidi/CPSC6030_g11/blob/main/Article_original_figure_4.png">found here</a> . 
    
    <h1> Figure 1  </h1>
    <!--  <svg id="figure_1"></svg> -->
    <p> This is a visualization for all the passes within the first 5 minutes of the football game. The 'green' circles represent the originating location of the pass with the jersey-number of player who initiates the pass.
      The 'blue' circles represent the location of the player who is receiving the pass. The idea in the near future is to replace the lines with arrows to clearly show the passing dirrection and pattern. Furthermore, we will try to 
      make the visualisation interative to depict the passes for each one minute interval to understand the build-up of play for the resulting outcome(goal, shots, etc.). We will also try to change the appearance of the node to accomodate the 
      player jersey-number within the circle clearly.</p>
