            <h1> Influence of Passing Behavior in Football</h1>
            <p>
                Have you ever wondered the extent to which passing impacts the outcome of football? To study this, we
                have built a dashboard with the primary goal of answering the following research
                questions:
            </p>
            <p>
                1. How does passing behavior influence the outcome of a game?
                <br> 2. What is the impact of different players in the overall performance of the game?
                <br> 3. What are the passing styles and patterns of a particular team?

                <strong>Publication:</strong>
                <br>We were inspired by the publication “PassVizor: Toward Better Understanding of the Dynamics of
                Soccer Passes”, published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030359">IEEE Transactions on
                    Visualization and Computer Graphics</a>. The idea behind the paper is to derive underlying patterns
                in football passes to try to better understand the attacking styles. This helps in analyzing how players
                build an attack using different passing tactics.

                <strong>Motivation:</strong>
                <br> Football is a passing game. Although the outcome of a game is determined by the number of goals
                scored, it wouldn’t be possible to score goals without passing the ball. It is also important to
                acknowledge the fact that goal scoring is a team effort. The contributions of players in different
                positions must be accounted for to develop a proper understanding of the impact of players in a
                particular game.
                <br> Moreover, there is a misconception that goal scorers are the most important players in a team. From
                an informed standpoint, this is not true in most cases and there are several players contributing to the
                success of a team. The visualizations that we hope to achieve will clear this misconception and enable
                the viewer to have a better understanding of the game and players’ importance represented through
                passing dynamics.
