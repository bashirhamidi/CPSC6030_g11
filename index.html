            <h1> Dynamics of Passes in Football</h1>
            <p> <br> <br>
                Have you ever wondered the extent to which passing impacts the outcome of football? To study this, we
                have built a dashboard with the primary goal of answering the following research
                questions:
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="tab"></span>1. How do the passing dynamics differ between players within a game?
                <br> <br> <span class="tab"></span>2. What is the impact of different passing styles on the overall
                outcome of a game?
                <br> <br> <span class="tab"></span>3. What are the passing styles and patterns of a particular team?

            <h1> Background</h1>
            <!-- <p class="p2"> -->
            <p>
                <strong>Publication:</strong>
                <br>We were inspired by the publication “PassVizor: Toward Better Understanding of the Dynamics of
                Soccer Passes”, published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030359">IEEE Transactions on
                    Visualization and Computer Graphics</a>. The idea behind the paper is to derive underlying patterns
                in football passes to try to better understand the attacking styles. This helps in analyzing how players
                build an attack using different passing tactics.
                <br> The dataset used in the paper was not publicly available and we had to search for a dataset which
                most closely matches the data that was visualized in the paper.
                <br><span class="tab"></span>1. Deep learning algorithms were used to generate convolution matrices and
                identify phases in a game. A phase represented a brief stint of passes between a predefined set of
                players who were repeatedly involved in such a stint.
                <br><span class="tab"></span>2. The dataset used in our project did not contain the player movement data
                without the ball. Hence we could not replicate the real time events of the game in the pitch layout.

                <br><br><strong>Motivation:</strong>
                <br> Football is a passing game. Although the outcome of a game is determined by the number of goals
                scored, it wouldn’t be possible to score goals without passing the ball. It is also important to
                acknowledge the fact that goal scoring is a team effort. The contributions of players in different
                positions must be accounted for to develop a proper understanding of the impact of players in a
                particular game. Moreover, there is a misconception that goal scorers are the most important players in
                a team. From an informed standpoint, this is not true in most cases and there are several players
                contributing to the success of a team. This dashboard will clear this misconception and enable the
                viewer to have a better understanding of the game and players’ importance represented through
                passing dynamics.

                <br> The data has been compiled by StatsBomb and made freely available via the <a

                The subset of data selected is from a match between Real Madrid and Liverpool with a goal outcome of
                3-1.

                <br> <br> Here, we have filtered all the
                passes involving players of Real Madrid.

                <br> Real Madrid scored the goals at 50th, 63rd, and 82nd minutes.

                <br> There were also shots attempted at minutes 10, 14, 31, 32, 42, 44, 47, 50, 59, 63, 73, 81, and
                82.

                    The dashboard has five subcomponents:
                    <br><span class="tab"></span>1. a bar chart with the total number of passes per minute;
                    <br><span class="tab"></span>2. a node graph with player-level passing information;
                    <br><span class="tab"></span>3. a shot and goal graph indicating the interval for each;
                    <br><span class="tab"></span>4. a bird’s eye view detailing the passing pattern;
                    <br><span class="tab"></span>5. a statistics board showing the player-level statistics throughout
                    the entire game.

                    <br> <br>Use the directional arrows on the left and right and we will take you through each of these
                    sub components here and describe to you the various
                    interactions.

                <p class="p1">

                    The bar chart shows the total number of passes in every minute of the match for Real
                    Madrid players. The X-axis ranges from the beginning of the game (minute 0) to the end of overtime
                    (minute 92). There are a handful of minutes within the game that the opposing team, Liverpool, had
                    complete possession of the ball, such as minute 2 as seen below. As a result, you may not see any
                    bars within this figure for those minutes.

                    If you hover over these bars you will notice that the outline of the bars change color, and a number
                    appears on the top of the bars. The number indicates the total number of passes
                    during that minute. Please note that this includes even the passes that were incomplete or
                    intercepted by the opposing team.

                    You can click on the bar chart which would further change the fill color of the bar, shown
                    below. Clicking on the bar chart will allow you to explore the passing pattern during that
                    time interval, which we will demonstrate to you shortly.

                    Below the bar chart you will notice similar bars overlayed by nodes shown below. The nodes denote
                    that a player initiated at least one pass during that time interval. The horizontal lines represent
                    all the Real Madrid players with their jersey numbers. The colors represent the position of the
                    player within the team (defensive, midfield, and offensive). These same colors are used in other
                    elements of the dashboard to denote player-level data and a legend is provided to you for
                    convenience.

                    Between the bar chart and the detailed passing view, you will notice symbols for a “shot” as well as
                    a “goal”. This will be helpful to you as you decide which minutes of the game you want
                    to explore further. As you do this, also pay close attention to the minutes directly proceeding the
                    goal. Do you find any interesting patterns?

                <p class="p1">
                    Once you select a time interval using the bar chart, a play passing pattern will be shown to you on
                    the pitch (shown below). Player jersey numbers that you saw previously will continue to show here.
                    As the legend indicates the pass is initiated by the green players and ends at the red players. In
                    some cases, a player may be in possession of the ball and move, such as players 4 and 5 in this
                    figure.

                    formation you had seen in a previous figure). The players here are colored according to the same
                    pattern you had seen in the player-level passing view previously. Selecting a player here will give
                    you their statistics throughout the game. See if you can notice any interesting patterns with the
                    substitute players!
